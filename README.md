# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Titanic dataset, performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms.

## Description

The Python code provided here aims to accomplish the following tasks:

- Load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
- Perform data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables. This includes statistical analyses and visualizations.
- Apply various machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. Algorithms used include Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Generate predictions for the test dataset based on the trained models.
- Output the predictions to a CSV file for further analysis and submission.

## Contents

- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing passenger information (e.g., age, gender, ticket class) and the target variable (Survived).
- `test.csv`: Test dataset used for generating predictions.
- `Dataset` directory: Contains input and output CSV files used during data preprocessing and prediction generation.
- `Code` directory: Python code files for data preprocessing, EDA, and predictive modeling.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mukund604/Titanic-Dataset-Analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Titanic-Dataset-Analysis
    ```

3. Run the Python scripts in the `Code` directory following the sequential order of file names to perform data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

## Results

The models developed achieved the following accuracies on the test dataset:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes: XX%
- Linear Regression: XX%
- Support Vector Machines: XX%
